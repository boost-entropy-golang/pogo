# What is this?!

This is the _development version_ (DE) of the web interface for Pogo.

It is not recommended you use this for your own deployment, and instead rely on the auto-setup feature of the binary. If you still insist manually deploying your own binary, please consider downloading the latest `webassets.zip` release from [gmemstr/pogo-vue](https://github.com/gmmestr/pogo-vue/releases/latest), which contains the production version of the Vue.js interface. The interface in this repository should be considered "canary" or "nightly", and for testing routes and features during development. Thanks!
